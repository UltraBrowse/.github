# UltraBrowse Proxy has shut down. Thank you for using it.
UltraBrowse proxy has been shut down because of people using it for innapropriate content. We have also recieved orders from multiple people of authority to shut it down immediately. I apologize if this is taking you by surprise, but we have no choice. This org will continue to exist and a new proxy will be released this summer.
